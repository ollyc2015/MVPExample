# MVPExample

This is a simple Model View Presenter demo to introduce new developers to this architectural pattern.

The interface simply has a button and when pushed, the good ol "Hello World" string appears.

Learning MVP will help to keep your logic separate where possible, as this will reduce bugs improve readability and help with scalability.

Feel free to study how the classes interact with one another and start building on top of it!
